        The 1st _Biennale &#171;Strangers of Providence&#187; reveals the individual as a stranger and explores the
        potential for solidarity among them. Drawing inspiration from Albert Camus' novel "The Stranger," where the
        protagonist Meursault, living indifferently to societal norms, is eventually labeled as a 'stranger' and faces a
        tragic end.<br><br>

        While not as extreme as Meursault, we often question societal values in moments of discomfort – waking up early
        for work, enduring awkward situations, or facing man-made disasters. These instances, even in familiar places,
        turn us into strangers.<br><br>

        Providence, at the heart of Rhode Island, holds a symbolic meaning of divine will governing the world and
        universe. Its history, rooted in the separation of church and state advocated by Roger Williams, a pastor in the
        Massachusetts Bay Colony, began when he was expelled for challenging the unfair seizure of land from Native
        Americans. Williams, aided by natives, settled in the present-day Providence.<br><br>

        Migrants from Britain to the New World were strangers, yet they, too, turned Native Americans into strangers by
        seizing their land. Williams criticized the mistreatment and slaughter of natives, advocating peaceful
        coexistence. He proposed solidarity between strangers.<br><br>

        In the novel, Meursault's choices lead to complete societal alienation. Like Williams, we suggest overcoming
        such limits through solidarity. The unfamiliar sensations we experience individually become common ground
        connecting us.<br><br>

        In the exhibition, We would like to explore experiment practice by linking elements of each artist’s works
        (e.g., mind, voice, medium, theme, inspiration) to understand and empathize with different perspectives, aiming
        to discover the power of solidarity beyond the isolated feeling of being strangers.<br><br>
