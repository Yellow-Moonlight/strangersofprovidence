        Living within a limited time frame amidst an ever-expanding sea of information inevitably drives one to pursue efficiency. There arises an obsessive feeling that one must know all information, leading to a quest for rapidly and efficiently acquiring as much knowledge as possible. Along this path, the question "why?" gradually fades away, leaving only reasonless information behind. In this state of losing the purpose of existence within information, we unwittingly cease to think for ourselves, mistaking others' thoughts as our own. Whether browsing YouTube or engaging in social media, we become busier reading others' thoughts in comments than focusing on the content itself. We accept others' thoughts outright and mistake them for our own. Are we truly living according to our own will? Can we consider this a state of true freedom? In this easily swept-away reality, what attitude should we adopt? I aim to observe such situations. 
        As a method to avoid being swept away, I intend to savor time slowly and inefficiently deliberately, contrary to the desire to efficiently consume everything quickly within a short period. I seek to identify and acknowledge time spent entirely for oneself, not swept along by external influences. As a means to achieve this, instead of spending time quickly and efficiently, I choose to deliberately spend it slowly and thoughtfully. By using time inefficiently within set limits, I may not obtain all necessary information. However, by slowly savoring my own time, I contemplate "What do I truly desire?" and "Where do I wish to go?", aiming to achieve genuine freedom.
        I express my discovered fragments of time through knitting, a method that allows me to fully experience the passage of time. Knitting, which takes a long time, aims not to conform to the modern pursuit of faster and more efficient methods but rather encapsulates the process of slowly savoring and acknowledging time as described earlier.<br><br>

        I wanted to connect Anna's way of expressing time with my own work. Like me, Anna talks about time. What intrigued me about Anna was the stark contrast between our environments. I have spent my entire life in the region where I currently live, attending a school not far from home, never having experienced life as a stranger. In contrast, Anna immigrated from Romania to the United States and pursued her studies in distant places, likely experiencing life as an outsider firsthand. In her work, she discusses the contradictions she faces and how these contradictions accumulate over time, shaping her. I usually describe time as being intertwined with the relationships I experience, expressing this through knitting. However, inspired by Anna, I want to depict time as the accumulation of facing and embracing the realities I encounter.<br><br>

        In today's world, people live under the heavy influence of the online realm. We find ourselves swept away by the relentless influx of information we encounter in this digital space. This phenomenon creates the illusion that we belong to this online environment, yet it blinds us to our own selves. Amidst such circumstances, I choose to distance myself and become a stranger to this space. By intentionally placing myself in the state of an outsider, I aim to pause the incessant flow of information and allow time for reflection. Through my perspective, I seek to capture those unfamiliar moments that become a reality, not letting them pass by, but slowly accumulating and weaving them together, immersing myself solely in my own time.
