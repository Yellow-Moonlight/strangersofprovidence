        In today's world, people live under the heavy influence of the online realm. We find ourselves swept away by the relentless influx of information we encounter in this digital space. This phenomenon creates the illusion that we belong to this online environment, yet it blinds us to our own selves. Amidst such circumstances, I choose to distance myself and become a stranger to this space. By intentionally placing myself in the state of an outsider, I aim to pause the incessant flow of information and allow time for reflection. Through my perspective, I seek to capture those unfamiliar moments that become a reality, not letting them pass by, but slowly accumulating and weaving them together, immersing myself solely in my own time.
