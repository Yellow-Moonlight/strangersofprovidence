        About the ways to cross the river.<br><br>
        
        We try to cross the river in various ways. We have a fear of the river because we don't know much about the river and the land across it. We don't know how wide it is, how deep it is, how fast it flows, etc... Because of our fear of the river, we perceive crossing it as a very difficult task.<br><br>

        For this exhibition, I printed the existing drawings in black and white, except for the last page, referring to the black and white photographs by Seungwon. <br><br>

        But maybe the river is really a narrow, shallow, slow river, and we can simply walk across it. I hope we can walk across the river together.<br><br>
