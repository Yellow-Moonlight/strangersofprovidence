        About the ways to cross the river.<br><br>

        We try to cross the river in various ways. We have a fear of the river because we don't know much about the river and the land across it. We don't know how wide it is, how deep it is, how fast it flows, etc... Because of our fear of the river, we perceive crossing it as a very difficult task. I imagined various ways to cross the river and also referenced Keana's portal for this exhibition.<br><br>
         
        But maybe the river is really a narrow, shallow, slow river, and we can simply walk across it. I hope we can walk across the river together.
