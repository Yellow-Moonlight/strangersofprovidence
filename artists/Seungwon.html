        <b>Awkward Gaze</b>
         Through Albert Camus' "The Stranger," I have grappled with existential questions about what keeps us alive. In the novel, some may argue that the protagonist Meursault's acceptance of his execution is a choice of social exclusion, but I disagree. I believe Meursault's death, encompassing everything that happens in the novel—including his complete lack of emotion, even towards his mother's death early in the story—culminates in the sense of intimacy he feels towards his mother just before his execution. This allows Meursault to finally die as a complete human being.
         As someone who literally does not belong anywhere, I wish to use the expression "awkward gaze" through my artwork. My body is present in this place, but I see myself as an observer, roaming the small neighborhood of Providence. Therefore, I often wander through many places with an awkward gaze. Yet, even for someone like me, through expressions of spiritual communion and shared meaning with others, I aim to feel alive in this small city, not as a stranger but as a person.<br><br>

         Through Kahee's work "Requiem for Tulips," I felt that human intervention, whims, and decisions are exploiting nature today as a human interest. Not only tulips but anything deemed valuable by humans is used, and when it has no value, it is ruthlessly discarded. Kahee's work made me question human ethics again. Influenced by this, my photographs carry the meaning of revisiting and standing in solidarity with marginalized people. Although I wander many places with an awkward gaze, I aim to show the theme of solidarity so that no one is alienated and we can move forward together.
