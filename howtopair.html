        <b>Bae Kahee → Park Joohee</b><br><br>
        In Park Joohee's works, the use of materials such as cement and iron mesh directly reveals the structured reality of society. In contrast, Bae Kahee's works use the element of tulips to metaphorically critique the controlled social reality. Considering this, what aspects of Kahee's work might directly address issues of social structure, and how can these be connected to the elements in Joohee's works?<br><br>
        <b>Park Joohee → Moon Seongjoo</b><br><br>
        Park Joohee's "Labor Container” is set in spaces where grandmothers engage in labor. In Moon Seongjoo's work, the river represents a symbolic space created by our social structures, a barrier difficult to cross, highlighting marginalized individuals. While the bowl symbolizes the tools of the grandmothers' labor, the river represents the space where their labor is performed and concealed. Combining the image of the river in "Labor Container" can bring attention to marginalized people and prompt reflection on our perspectives towards them.<br><br>
       <b>Moon Seongjoo → Keana Walters</b><br><br>
        Moon Seongjoo and Keana Walters' works explore the sense of unfamiliarity towards certain subjects. Seongjoo feels unfamiliarity towards the space of the river, which represents a controlled social structure, while Keana reflects on the points where familiar people become unfamiliar. Like Keana's works, Seongjoo can consider the moments of unfamiliarity felt not only towards social structures but also towards familiar subjects.<br><br>
        <b>Keana Walters → Baek Seungwon</b><br><br>
        Keana Walters' works discuss the unfamiliar aspects discovered in familiar people. In contrast, Baek Seungwon's works focus on the unfamiliar landscapes of Providence from the perspective of a Stranger. It is hoped that Keana, who focuses on the unfamiliarity felt towards people, will also consider the unfamiliarity of spaces.<br><br>
        <b>Baek Seungwon → Bae Kahee</b><br><br>
        Both Baek Seungwon and Bae Kahee's works speak to the importance of solidarity. Seungwon discusses the solidarity of individual Strangers, while Kahee approaches the solidarity of Strangers from a macro perspective. By incorporating Kahee's perspective into Seungwon's works, we can consider a broader concept of solidarity beyond the individual viewpoint.<br><br>
        <b>Hwang Jaewon ↔ Ana Popescu</b><br><br>
        In Ana Popescu's works, the perspective of a Stranger is considered amidst contradictory situations encountered in changing physical environments.
        Ana Popescu's works prompt reflection on the Stranger amidst the contradictory situations caused by changes in the physical environment. In contrast, Hwang Jaewon's works attempt to detach from the rapid flow of information online. Faced with physical or non-physical states of being Strangers, they each focus on the fear and contradictions of unfamiliar landscapes, not letting them pass by but slowly weaving them into their own time. Ana can reflect on the non-physical contradictions in Jaewon's works that can be connected to her own, while Jaewon can contemplate the physical contradictions encountered in Ana's works, exploring the possibility of expanded solidarity.
